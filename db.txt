To use this program you must have two database, password.db and warehouse.db
the first has a table called password with this structure
create table password (
user varchar(30),
password varchar(30));

while the second has two table 
CREATE TABLE warehouse(
code varchar(30) primary key,
name varchar(30),
type varchar(30),
price double,
number int);

CREATE TABLE earn 
(
money double 
);
